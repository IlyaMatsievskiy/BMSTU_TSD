# Data Types and Structures Laboratory Work (C++)

This repository contains my laboratory work for the course **Data Types and Structures**, implemented in C++. Each folder includes the following:
- C++ code.
- A report written in LaTeX.
- A PDF version of the report.
- All necessary LaTeX files required for compilation.

## Lab Topics

### AVL Tree
The implementation of an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree, which ensures that the height remains O(log n) by balancing itself after insertions and deletions.

### Complete Search
This lab involves solving problems using the brute-force or exhaustive search approach, systematically considering all possible solutions.

### Graph Structures
The implementation of various graph structures such as binary tree, along with algorithms for traversing and processing graphs (e.g., DFS, BFS).

### Huffman Compression
This lab focuses on the implementation of Huffman coding, a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies.

### Levenshtein Distance
An implementation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm, which calculates the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into another.

### Long Arithmetic
This lab involves the implementation of algorithms for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on very large numbers that exceed standard data type limits.

### Matrix Multiplication
The implementation of standard and optimized matrix multiplication algorithms, focusing on reducing time complexity in matrix operations.

### Reverse Polish Notation
This lab focuses on the implementation of a calculator that evaluates expressions written in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which does not require parentheses for precedence.

### Sparse Matrix Compression
An implementation of techniques for compressing sparse matrices to save space, along with algorithms to perform operations on compressed matrices.

### Travelling Salesman Problem
The implementation of solutions to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
